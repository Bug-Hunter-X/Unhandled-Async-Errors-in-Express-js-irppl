# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Express.js
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications: unhandled errors within asynchronous request handlers.  The provided code showcases a scenario where an error is thrown within a promise, yet the Express server continues to operate without explicitly reporting the error.

## Problem
Asynchronous operations are fundamental to many Express.js applications. However, errors thrown within these operations are not automatically caught by Express.js's middleware unless properly managed.

## Solution
The solution involves using a centralized error handling mechanism within Express.js using `app.use(errorHandler)` which intercepts and handles all uncaught errors throughout the application.  Proper error handling is crucial to providing robust and reliable applications.
